## My Christmas Reward Calendar

**My Christmas Reward Calendar** is a simple React single-page web application featuring an advent calendar that allows users to collect Christmas symbols and win gift cards. It's inspired by the "Scan Fu" ðŸ§§ campaign from Alipay for Chinese New Year. It combines the joy of Christmas with the tradition of Chinese New Year, a blend of two major cultural holidays, celebrating holiday cheer and excitement.
